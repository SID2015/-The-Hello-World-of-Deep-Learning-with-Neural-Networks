# -The-Hello-World-of-Deep-Learning-with-Neural-Networks
Creating a neural networks, where it learns the relationship between two numbers.

We have trained a deep neural network where it learns the relationship between two numbers

float train_function(float x){
    float y = (2 * x) - 1;
    return y;
}


Step 2

we will create the simplest possible neural network. It has 1 layer, and that layer has 1 neuron,
and the input shape to it is just 1 value.

The LOSS function measures the guessed answers against the known correct answers and measures 
how well or how badly it did.

It then uses the OPTIMIZER function to make another guess. Based on how the loss function went,
it will try to minimize the loss. At that point maybe it will come up with somehting like y=5x+5, which, while still pretty bad, is closer to the correct result (i.e. the loss is lower)


Step 3
